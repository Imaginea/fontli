					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<h4>What is Fontli?</h4>
					<p>
						Fontli is a social network for typography enthusiasts. It is a Imaginea Labs project at Imaginea, a business division of Pramati Technologies. What makes Fontli different from other photo sharing applications is its typography centric design features. Users can spot a Typeface by simple photo tagging and Fontli gives extended information on the Typeface such as designer/Foundry info and other pictures tagged with the typeface. Going forward, we have many more interesting ideas that we want to experiment and integrate with the app.
					</p>
					<h4>How does Font Tagging Work?</h4>
					<p>
						Fontli is hooked up to the huge library of fonts supplied by <a href="http://new.myfonts.com" target="blank">myfonts.com</a>.
